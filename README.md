#Notes
-Included are two basic scripts that demonstrate Vanilla File I/O in Python. Both take .csv inputs and produce .txt outputs.
-As an additional challenge to myself, I used list comprehensions (rather than traditional for loop) for the analysis portion of the code.
-I will admit that the output section could be more Pythonic, but writing to a text file is laborious, and I lost the motivation to make it pretty.

#Enjoy!
